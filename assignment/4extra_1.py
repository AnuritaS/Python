'''
1.	Files that have to be ready for the program â€“ vocab.txt, stopwords.txt and book.txt. The file vocab.txt has a list of words. The file book.txt has a paragraph or a short story. The file stopwords.txt has the common words like - is, was, are, their, her, his etc. Your program should
a.	Remove the stop words from the content book.txt, referring to stopwords.txt.
b.	Find words from book.txt that are in vocab.txt. Find the frequency of occurrence of each word.
c.	Find the words from book.txt that are not in vocab.txt. List the words. Ask the user if these words could be added to vocab.txt.
d.	If the user enters yes, append the new words to vocab.txt, else end the program.
